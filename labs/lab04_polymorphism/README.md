# 3081 Lab04 Polymorphism and Debugging with GDB
_(Due **Tuesday**, October 5, 2021 @ 11:59)_

## What You Will Learn
1. How to add the debugging flag to your Makefile compilation targets
2. How to enter the gdb environment
3. How to use gdb commands to debug your programs
4. How to detect memory inefficiencies using Valgrind
5. Become familiar with polymorphism and virtual methods.

### Retrieve class materials and merge into your personal repository

  > _This is the same as in previous labs._

  Navigate to your repository.

      $ cd <path_to_your_repository's_root_folder>

  Pull the updated materials into your _support-code_ branch. Ensure you are in the _support-code_ branch by executing the _git status_ command.

      $ git status

  The output should begin with the branch you are currently on. If it says _On branch support-code_,
  you're all set. If you are still in _main_, checkout the _support-code_ branch.

      $ git checkout support-code

  Check for updates from the shared-upstream repository.

      $ git pull upstream support-code

  Add any updates into your own work in the _main_ branch.

      $ git checkout main
      $ git merge support-code

#### Merge conflicts?

If you encounter any errors during the pull or merge steps above, you may need to resolve a merge conflict. Git will tell you which files have merge conflicts.

It is recommended that you use a merge tool to help you handle these conflicts. The editor 'atom' has been recommended by the TAs [for resolving conflicts](https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/github-package/#resolve-conflicts)

### What's in Lab04?

This file:

 - README.md

Other files to be used and modified IF NECESSARY:

 - entity.h/.cc
 - drone.h/.cc
 - robot.h/.cc
 - tree.h/.cc
 - main.cc
 - Makefile

### Debugging with GDB

1. First, build the example program with _make_.

    ````
    $ make
    ````
2. Then, run the program:
    ````
    $ ./entity_app
    ````
    See that the program quits in a Segmentation Fault. In the following steps, we will try to diagnose the problem.

3. You need to compile the code so that it can be run inside the debugger. This is a flag that can be set in the Makefile. For each of the compilation statements in the makefile, we need the `-g` flag.  We can do this by adding -g to CXXFLAGS to tell the compiler to generate debug code. For example:

    ````
    CXXFLAGS = -std=c++11 -g
    ````

    Now, recreate the executable, with the debugging flags used this time.

    ````
	$ make clean
	$ make
	````

4. Start a debugging session on an executable file by typing _gdb <executable>_
    ````
    $ gdb entity_app
    ````

5. Once in the debugger session (the prompt will change to (**gdb**)). Then, execute the program with _run_.
6. The program _entity_app_ will run and crash with the following output (your output may look slightly different):
    ````
    (gdb) run
    Starting program: /home/user/repo/labs/lab04_polymorphism/entity_app 
    warning: Error disabling address space randomization: Operation not permitted

    Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
    0x000055c43e2c805b in Tree::Tree (this=0x55c43ff72f50, name="Oak", x=50, y=50)
        at tree.h:11
    9	        pos[0] = x;
    ````

7. Attempt to discover where (and why) in the provided code, the fault is occurring.
In this case, the line number causing the error is provided. If the location is not in the provided code, use the _gdb bt_ command (bt stands for "backtrace") to determine where the fault occurs. Type _bt_ now to see the where the execution stopped in each method:
    ````
    (gdb) bt
    #0  0x0000557bef78e0ab in Tree::Tree (this=0x557bf0c4af50, name="Oak", x=50, 
        y=50) at tree.h:11
    #1  0x0000557bef78d918 in main (argc=1, argv=0x7ffe5db81d18) at main.cc:38
    ````

    The backtrace shows that execution stopped in the method _Tree(name, x, y)_ constructor. This constructor was called from _main()_ on line 38 of _main.cc_.

    The above backtrace indicates that the error happened on line 11 of _tree.h_. Edit the file, and look at line 11. Why is this causing an error?

    Let's fix this error by modifying the code in _tree.h_.  We can use gdb to print out the variables using the debugger.  Try the following:

    ````
    (gdb) print x
    $1 = 50
    (gdb) print y
    $2 = 50
    (gdb) print pos
    $3 = (double *) 0x0
    ````

    On line 11 of Tree.h, it appears we are trying to set values into the _pos_ array, which is NULL.  The easiest solution is to create the array on the stack instead of an uninitalized pointer.  Instead of `double* pos` we can define it as `double pos[2]`.  Recompile _entity_app_ with _make_, and run the program again.

8. We see another segfault, so let's start the debugger (steps 4-6).  Now we get the following output when we type _bt_ for viewing the backtrace:

    ````
    (gdb) bt
    #0  __GI_raise (sig=sig@entry=6) at ../sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/raise.c:51
    #1  0x00007fb8048e3921 in __GI_abort () at abort.c:79
    #2  0x00007fb80492c967 in __libc_message (action=action@entry=do_abort, 
        fmt=fmt@entry=0x7fb804a59b0d "%s\n") at ../sysdeps/posix/libc_fatal.c:181
    #3  0x00007fb8049339da in malloc_printerr (
        str=str@entry=0x7fb804a57d20 "free(): invalid size") at malloc.c:5342
    #4  0x00007fb80493af1c in _int_free (have_lock=0, p=0x7ffc388ffc10, 
        av=0x7fb804c8ec40 <main_arena>) at malloc.c:4171
    #5  __GI___libc_free (mem=0x7ffc388ffc20) at malloc.c:3134
    #6  0x000055d95b797de3 in main (argc=1, argv=0x7ffc388ffd58) at main.cc:69

    ````

    Fortunately, _gdb_ allows users to navigate the backtrace by typing _up_ and _down_.  When output looks like the above, often it is easiest to look for the highest file in your code.  In this case it is _main.cc:69_.  Let's traverse the backtrace to this location with the _up_ command.  We want to go up 6 levels in the backtrace to #6:

    ````
    (gdb) up 6
    #6  0x000055d95b797de3 in main (argc=1, argv=0x7ffc388ffd58) at main.cc:68
    68	      delete entities[i];
    ````

    Now that we are at this level of the backtrace, we can use _print_ to find out more information.  For example, we can print the entities and the specific entity we are trying to delete by printing i.  We can also print other information:

    ````
    (gdb) print entities
    $25 = std::vector of length 6, capacity 8 = {0x7ffd392430e0, 0x562288ec2f50, 
      0x562288ec2fa0, 0x562288ec3020, 0x562288ec2eb0, 0x562288ec30a0}
    (gdb) print i          
    $26 = 0
    (gdb) print entities[0]
    $27 = (Entity *) 0x7ffd392430e0
    (gdb) print entities[0]->GetName()
    $28 = "Entity"
    ````

    Notice how the _up_, _down_, and _print_ commands help us find out more information.  In this case, the problem appears to be with trying to delete a the first entity in the vector.  Fix the problem, recompile _entity_app_ with _make_, and run the program again.  You may fix the problem howevever you like.

    There are several causes of "Segmentation faults" in this program. Use _gdb_ to help to identify and fix each issue until it runs correctly (see step 7). You might find the commands _up_ and _print_ particularly useful.

9. In this program there is a base class called Entity.  MovableEntity and Tree inherit directly from Entity.  Drone and Robot inherit from MoveableEntity.  A robot moves around in a circle of a specified radius and a drone moves in a direction at a specified velocity.  A tree stays in one place.  When your program is running correctly, running the executable should output the following:

    ````
    Time = 0:
    --------------
    Drone-A, 0, 0, 0
    Oak, 50, 50
    Johnny-Five, 1, 0
    Maple, 100, 100

    If your output does not look like the above, you will need to continue debugging your program to get the correct output.  Most likely, there are other bugs in the program besides segfaults.  Consider the following common errors to look for:

     - **Virtual Methods** - Check to see whether methods are polymorphic.  Should some of the methods be declared virtual.
     - **Arrays (Required - implement this change)** - Using double* arrays as arguments and return types is often not safe.  Bad things usually do happen!  For example is hard to tell how big the array is and we might accidently overwrite a pointer.  Change these into a std::vector<double> or user defined class (e.g. Vector3) instead of double*.  An added bonus of using std::vector<double> is you can get the size of the array.
     - **Virtual Destructors** - If a base class does not have a virtual destructor, subclass destructors will not be called.
     - **Referencing Parameters** - It is possible to send in a pointer or reference into a method or constructor and set the memory address, however, that parameter may go out of scope or get deleted elsewhere in the program.
     - **Unique Pointers** - If you are using dynamic memory, it's often a good idea to use a unique_ptr<type> instead of _new_ and _delete_ if possible.  This way, the pointer will be deleted by the unique_ptr and there will not be a memory leak.
     - **new / delete** - Remember anytime we add an object to the heap with _new_ we must also _delete_ it.  Also, be sure to use the correct forms of new and delete.  For example if you create an array with _new_ be sure to use _delete[]_ when you delete it.
     - **Casting** - Be sure to use static_cast<>, dynamic_cast<>, and reinterpret_cast<> correctly.
	
     **Note: You may fix these errors however you want.  Perhaps consider adding more polymorphic methods or changing method signitures (return types / parameters).**

10. If you're familiar with Java, you know that the jvm handles recycling the memory dynamically allocated in the heap. However, in C/C++ the memory is not recycled automatically, meaning your program is prone to memory leakage where your programs can run out memory. All the memory that is allocated dynamically must be recycled using  [`free(void*)`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/free/) which should be used when using `malloc`,`calloc` which are used in the C programming language memory calls. Since we are programming in C++ these should not be used in this class.

    In C++, the `new` operator is used to dynamically allocate memory. When using the `new` operator you need to use `delete ptrName`. Click [`here`](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/g-fact-30/) for more information. When dynamically allocating an array using `new [] ` you need to use `delete [] ptrName`. Click [`here`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/new/operator%20delete[]/) for more information. **Note: `delete/delete[]` are specific to C++ while `free` works on both C/C++.**  

    With this information, you might be thinking, how can I detect possible memory leaks?  

    This is where using `Valgrind` is helpful in detecting memory leaks. Click [here](https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/quick-start.html) to reference the manual. The Valgrind tool suite provides a number of debugging and profiling tools that help you make your programs faster and more correct. The most popular of these tools is called **Memcheck**. Memcheck helps you by identifying possible memory-related issues in your C/C++ programs.

> ### Note: Step 10 depends on the successful completion of step 9, so please make sure you finish step 9 before completing this step. 

### To run Valgrind on your program follow the steps below:

  * Make sure valgrind is installed in your system (valgrind is by default installed on CSE machines and the docker environment) by typing `valgrind` in your command prompt. If you're using your own linux machine, on command prompt run `sudo apt install valgrind`.
  
  * Make sure you compile your code in debugging mode, just like the steps above in running gdb.
  
  * Then, assuming your program `program` needs two arguments `arg1 arg2`to run on the command prompt (e.g. `./program arg1 arg2`), simply run `valgrind --leak-check=yes ./program arg1 arg2`

    After running valgrind, if the end of your output looks like below, then you've completed the coding part of the lab!

    If not, don't worry: all you need to do is delete all the dynamically allocated memory using the **appropriate** deallocation methods. Here's a [link](http://cs.ecs.baylor.edu/~donahoo/tools/valgrind/messages.html) that talks about some common error messages on Valgrind Memcheck.

    When your output looks like the output in step 9 and there are no memory leaks from step 10, you have completed the coding part of the lab!

### Pushing Results

Making sure no additional files are being pushed.

    $ git status

This should list all the files that have changed and/or are untracked. If other files are also listed as being ready to stage for commit, you may need to update your .gitignore to make sure you don't push those files(*.o,executables).

### Add Changes to Repo both Locally and on the Server

[This text is the same as in previous labs.] You need to _stage_ all changes to the repository, which prepares those items to
be permanently part of the repository. When you _commit_ those changes, they are saved to your local repository, which lives in your cselabs account (or your
personal computer if that is what you are working on). When you _push_ those changes, they will be copied to the repo on the server. The difference between
_commit_ and _push_ is what separates git from centralized version control systems.

    $ git status
    $ git add -A
    $ git commit -m "Adding lab04 deliverables"
    $ git push

**_What just happened?_** Double-checking the files to be staged using the _git status_ command. All of the tracked changes are staged with `git add -A`. Those staged changes were committed to your local repository and tagged with the message that follows `-m`, then pushed to the server in your remote repository.

### Submitting your Lab
_(Gradescope submission will be available on Monday, October 4th, 2021)_

Submit your work by uploading the following files to Gradescope for the Lab04 assignment.  Your code will be automatically graded and your score recorded.

 - entity.h/.cc
 - drone.h/.cc
 - robot.h/.cc
 - tree.h/.cc
 - main.cc
 - Makefile

You are welcome to keep changing and submitting this lab up to the deadline.  Gradescope will recompile and test your code.  If for some reason the automated feedback does not work for you, TAs can also manually verify your submission.

THIS LAB IS COMPLETE.

Congratulations!

# Iteration 1: Checkpoint 3 - Image Filters
_(Due Thursday, October 7, 2021 @ 11:59)_

This extended lab checkpoint continues to investigate polymorphism by adding image filtering to our image processing project.  Use the skills you learned in Lab04 to help debug your code and build more stable software.  In this checkpoint, your goal is to create a set of image filters using inheritence and polymorphism.

## What You Will Learn

1. How to read a UML diagram and use it to create a class structure.
2. How to override virtual methods.
3. How to call methods from a base class.
4. Examples of how to use unique pointers, vectors, and maps.
5. How to create simple image filters.

### Getting Started

Navigate to lab04_polymorphism/checkpoint3 in one of the development environments (VOLE / CSE Labs, SSH, Docker):

```bash
% cd x500-repo/labs/lab04_polymorphism/checkpoint3
```

### What's in labs/lab04_polymorphism/checkpoint3

- Makefile:
  - This makefile is provided to automate the building of your project.  You may edit this if you need.

- main.cc:
  - This file contains the main application that handles image processing (loading in an image, filtering it, and saving the results).  You may edit this file to meet your needs.

### What You Will Add

- filter.h

- greyscale_filter.h/.cc

- threshold_filter.h/.cc

- mean_blur_filter.h/.cc

- Other Necessary Files 
  - Any other file or classes needed to read in images (e.g. image.h/.cc, stb_image.h, and stb_image_write.h).  You are welcome to add other classes that could be helpful.

### Goal

<hr>
  **The primary goal of this checkpoint is for you to create a set of filters that can be applied to images.  To do this, you will need to use inheritence and polymorphism.**
<hr>

### Getting Started

Navigate to lab04_polymorphism/checkpoint3 in one of the development environments (VOLE / CSE Labs, SSH, Docker).  Copy your code from Checkpoint 2 and import the stbi_image libraries along with the Image class you created.  Include any additional files you may have created for Checkpoint 2.  

**Note:** If for some reason you were not able to complete or had issues with Checkpoint 2, you are welcome to use a teammate's solution to complete checkpoint 3.  In other words, you can copy the Checkpoint 2 files from a teammate.

You can run the program with the following commands using the provided `Makefile` and `main.cc`.  **Note:** Initially the program will not compile because you will need to add the filter code.

```bash
% cd x500-repo/labs/lab03_memory/checkpoint2
% make
% ./image_processor
```

### Study the Filter UML

Study the UML below depicting a simple Filter inheritance hierarchy:

<img src="checkpoint3/Filters.png" alt="" width="1000"/>

The diagram shows Filter as a base class and three derived classes.  Each subclass overrides the Apply(...) method.  This is shown as psuedocode in the UML class diagram.  We will implement all of these classes:

 * **Filter** - The Filter class is an abstract class that defines the pure virtual method Apply(original, filtered).  Original is a set of input images and filtered is a set of output images.  For the filters we will write in this checkpoint, we only need to use the first image, however, for future filters we may need more than one input or output images.
 * **GreyScaleFilter** - Changes the image into a grey scale image based on image luminance (see calculation below).  It takes each pixel, calculates the luminance by aggregrating each component, and sets a new output pixel that uses this luminance value for red, green, and blue.
 * **ThresholdFilter** - Calculates the luminance for each pixel and sets the output pixel as black or write depending on the threshold value passed in through the constructor.
 * **MeanBlurFilter** - This is actually a convolution filter (which we will talk about soon in class).  For each pixel, it takes an average of all surrounding pixels including itself.  So, since there are 9 pixels total in the neighborhood, we add all pixels together and divide by 9.0.  This math should be done using floating point arithmetic verses integer arithmetic.

### Working with Colors

It is recommended that you create a Color class to handle the calculations needed for adding colors together and multiplying by constants.  Colors can be added, subtracted, and multiplied by scalars (e.g. +, -, and * operators).  It is sometimes easier to treat the red, green, blue, and alpha channels as numbers between 0 and 1, rather than between 0 and 255.  Therefore, to translate a pixel value from a byte to a floating point value you can use the following formula: `color.red = 1.0(pixel.red)/255.0`.  To change it back into a byte, you can use: `pixel.red = color.red*255`.  Instead of working with raw bytes, consider using this Color class in `Image::GetPixel(...)` and `Image::SetPixel(...)`.  It may make this project much more manageable.

You can calculate the luminance with the following function:

```c++
float GetLuminance() {
     return 0.2126*red + 0.7152*green + 0.0722*blue;
}
```

For more information on the theory behind this calculation, please refer to <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luma_(video)>.  

### Apply the Filters

After creating the filters and including them in _main.cc_, you should be able to use them to filter images.  You can build and run with the following command:

```bash
% make clean
% make
% ./image_processor <inputPath> <filterType> <outputPath>
```

The input path can be any path to a PNG file.  The output path is a PNG where the output is saved.  Finally, the filter type allows us to specify the specific filter operation we would like to accomplish.  In _main.cc_ there is a map (similar to a dictionary in Javascript or Python), which maps strings to Filters.  The filter type that is passed in will find the associated filter and call Apply(...).  Since Apply(...) is a vitual method, it will call the overriden Apply(...) method in the subclass though polymorphism.

The following are examples that show how to filter images:

```bash
% # Apply a threshold filter
% ./image_processor data/statue.png threshold data/statue-threshold.png
% # Apply a threshold at 0.25
% ./image_processor data/statue.png threshold-low data/statue-threshold-low.png
% # Apply a threshold at 0.75
% ./image_processor data/statue.png threshold-high data/statue-threshold-high.png
% # Apply a greyscale filter
% ./image_processor data/statue.png greyscale data/statue-greyscale.png
% # Apply a mean blur filter
% ./image_processor data/statue.png mean_blur data/statue-mean_blur.png
```
**Note:** If you are debugging multiple argument programs with _gdb_, use the `--args` parameter after _gdb_.  For example:

```bash
% gdb --args ./image_processor data/statue.png mean_blur data/statue-mean_blur.png
```

If your program correctly filters the images with the commands above, you are done with this checkpoint!

### Add Changes to Repo both Locally and on the Server

[This text is the same as in previous labs.] You need to _stage_ all changes to the repository, which prepares those items to
be permanently part of the repository. When you _commit_ those changes, they are saved to your local repository, which lives in your cselabs account (or your
personal computer if that is what you are working on). When you _push_ those changes, they will be copied to the repo on the server. The difference between
_commit_ and _push_ is what separates git from centralized version control systems.

    $ git status
    $ git add -A
    $ git commit -m "Adding lab04 deliverables"
    $ git push

**_What just happened?_** Double-checking the files to be staged using the _git status_ command. All of the tracked changes are staged with `git add -A`. Those staged changes were committed to your local repository and tagged with the message that follows `-m`, then pushed to the server in your remote repository.


### Submitting your Checkpoint 3 (staring Tuesday, 10/5/2021)

Submit your work by uploading the following files to Gradescope for the Checkpoint2 assignment (which will be available starting Tuesday evening, October 5, 2021).  Your code will be automatically graded and your score recorded.  Upload the following:

 - Makefile
 - *.h
 - *.cc
 - Any other relevant files
 - *Note:* You do not need to submit PNG images or the stbi_image*.h libraries.

You are welcome to keep changing and submitting this checkpoint up to the deadline.  Gradescope will recompile and test your code.

THIS CHECKPOINT IS COMPLETE.

Congratulations!
