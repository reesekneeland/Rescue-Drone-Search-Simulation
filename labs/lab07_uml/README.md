# Lab 7 - UML

*(Due **Thursday**, November 11th @ 11:59 PM)*

## What you'll learn today:
<ol>
  <li>  How to understand the Iteration 2 project specification.
  <li>  How to design components of a system using UML.
</ol>

### Part A - Iteration 2

Read through the [Iteration 2 Specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GbV9uZFnCM5gRT09fQgE1In0vyJ7bGO7FndG4EE1Xmw/edit?usp=sharing). Then answer the questions in the Gradescope assignment "Lab 7 - Part A".  You may complete this as many times as you would like.  

### Part B - UML

In the Iteration 2 Specification, look through the table in "3.0 - Informal Backlog".  Think about the requirements that most interest you, or what you would like to complete for Iteration 2.  For this assignment do not include tests.  Come up with a set of 25 points (recall that you can split these points however you would like).  For example, you could do 2 points in the Drone Movement and 10 points in path finding.  Write down the categories and point distributions so that the total adds up to 25 points.  You will not actually have to implement what you choose (this will be decided later during sprint planning meetings).

Create a detailed UML Class diagram of your approach.  This diagram should how you would construct the system needed to complete the 25 points of work defined above.  Include related classes that you will need to interact with.  Here are items worth considering:

 * Include relevant classes, attributes, and operations.
 * Add the correct relationships between classes (e.g. generalizations, associations, and dependencies).
 * Use italics or other visual clues to show that classes are abstract and methods are pure virtual.
 * Be sure to implement relevant patterns to make your code flexible.  This means understanding the recommended design patterns and working them into your design if useful.
 * Make sure your diagram is clear and easy to understand.  Move classes and arrows around to remove visual clutter.

You may do this on paper or with an electronic drawing program.  We recommend using [Lucid Charts](https://lucid.app), a free chart making tool similar to Google Docs.  You can sign in using your UMN credentials and share with your team.  In Lucid Charts you will need to add the UML shapes.

#### TA Checkoff

To get credit for Part B of the lab, show your diagram to a TA and get feedback.  TAs will discuss your design and make recommendations if it needs changes.  Once any TA is satisfied with your design, the TA will check it off and give you credit.

You may check off the assignment with a TA during lab or office hours.

THIS LAB IS COMPLETE.

Congratulations!
